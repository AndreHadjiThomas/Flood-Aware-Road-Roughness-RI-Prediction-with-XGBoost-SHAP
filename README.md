# Flood-Aware-Road-Roughness-RI-Prediction-with-XGBoost-SHAP
This repository predicts road surface roughness (RI) from roadway condition and flood/climate features using XGBoost, with SHAP for explainability. Includes intra-year and cross-year evaluation, optional BayesOpt/Optuna tuning, and a CLI that outputs metrics, feature importance, and plots.
